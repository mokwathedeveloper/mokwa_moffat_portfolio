# Contact Responsive Branch Documentation

This branch focuses on implementing responsive design for the contact section and improving its form styling.

## Features Implemented

- **Responsive Layout:** The contact section's layout now adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal display on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- **Vertical Stacking:** On smaller viewports, the contact form and text content within the `.contact-section .group` are now stacked vertically, enhancing readability and user experience.
- **Improved Form Styling:** The contact form inputs, including the email textbox, have been professionally styled for visual consistency and improved user interaction.
- **Typo Correction:** A typo in the `class` attribute of the email input's form group in `index.html` has been corrected, ensuring proper application of CSS styles.

## Component Structure

- **`styles.css`:** Contains the media queries for responsive adjustments and enhanced styling for the contact form elements.
- **`index.html`:** Includes the structural HTML for the contact section and the corrected `class` attribute for the email input's form group.
