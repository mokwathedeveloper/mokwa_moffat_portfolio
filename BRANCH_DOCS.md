# Hero Section Branch Documentation

This branch focuses on the development of the hero section for the portfolio website.

## Features Implemented

- **Compelling Introduction:** The hero section provides a concise and compelling introduction to the portfolio, including a main heading and a brief paragraph about my skills and experience.
- **Professional Headshot:** A professional headshot is included to add a personal touch to the portfolio.
- **Clear Call-to-Action:** The hero section includes clear call-to-action links to other sections of the portfolio, such as Skills, Projects, Education, and Contact.
- **Subtle Animations:** A subtle animation is added to the headshot to create a more engaging user experience.

## Component Structure

- **`index.html`:** The HTML structure for the hero section is contained within a `<section>` element with the class `hero-section`. It includes a `div` for the text content and a `div` for the headshot image.
- **`styles.css`:** The CSS for the hero section is implemented using a mobile-first approach. It includes styles for the layout, typography, and the headshot animation.
