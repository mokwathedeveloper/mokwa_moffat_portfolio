# Global Responsive Enhancements Branch Documentation

This branch aims to achieve a comprehensive "wow factor" and professional responsiveness across all components of the portfolio website, ensuring optimal display and user experience on every device and browser. This goes beyond basic media queries to fine-tune layouts, spacing, and interactions for a truly polished feel.

## Key Areas of Focus

-   **Testimony Section Responsiveness:** Specifically addressing the responsiveness of the testimonial carousel to ensure smooth transitions and proper display on all screen sizes, including a fix for perfect circular images.
-   **Skills Section Layout:** Optimizing the grid/flex layout of skill cards for various breakpoints.
-   **Project Section Layout:** Ensuring project cards adapt gracefully to different screen widths.
-   **Contact Form Responsiveness:** Refining the layout and input fields of the contact form for mobile and tablet views.
-   **Global Spacing and Alignment:** Reviewing and adjusting padding, margins, and alignment across all sections to maintain visual harmony and readability on diverse devices.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Continuous verification of changes across major browsers to prevent rendering issues.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Implementing adaptive image loading for faster page loads and better user experience.
-   **Accessibility Enhancements:** Incorporating `prefers-reduced-motion` to respect user preferences for animations.
-   **Subtle Animations:** Adding subtle animations to enhance visual appeal without distracting the user.

## Implemented Enhancements (Component by Component)

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   **Fluid Typography:** Implemented `clamp()` for `h3` elements in projects and navigation links (`nav .right a`) to ensure dynamic font sizing.
    -   **Logical Properties for Spacing:** Replaced directional margin properties (`margin-left`, `margin-right`) with logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, `margin-inline-end`) for improved internationalization and adaptability to different writing modes.
    -   **Refined Media Queries:** Consolidated and refined existing media queries for `max-width: 768px` and `max-width: 600px` to ensure consistent responsive behavior across sections, hero, contact, and footer.
    -   **Viewport-based Spacing:** Extended CSS Custom Properties (`--section-padding-x`, `--section-padding-y`, etc.) and applied `var()` with `clamp()` to `section` padding/margins and `nav` padding for fluid spacing.
    -   **Testimony Section Layout:** Applied `clamp()` to `padding`, `min-height`, image dimensions (`width`, `height`), and font sizes (`.testimonial-text`, `.testimonial-author`) within testimonial cards. Fixed circular images using `aspect-ratio: 1/1;` on `.testimonial-img`.
    -   **Skills Section Layout:** Optimized Flexbox for skill cards (`.skills-section .cells .cell`) using `flex: 1 1 200px;` and `max-width: 250px;` with responsive `gap`.
    -   **Project Section Layout:** Refined grid layout for project cards (`.projects-section .project-list`) using `minmax(clamp(280px, 40vw, 350px), 1fr)` and responsive `gap`.
    -   **Contact Section Responsiveness:** Applied `clamp()` to the `gap` property within `.contact-section .group`.
    -   **`prefers-reduced-motion`:** Added a media query to disable or reduce animations and transitions for users who prefer reduced motion.
    -   **Subtle Fade-in Animation:** Implemented a `fadeIn` keyframe animation and applied it to the `.content-fade-in` class for a smooth main content entrance.

2.  **`index.html`:**
    -   **Adaptive Image Loading:** Implemented `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for `images/hero-headshot.webp` to serve optimized images based on viewport size and device pixel ratio.
    -   Verified semantic HTML structure and viewport meta tag configuration.
