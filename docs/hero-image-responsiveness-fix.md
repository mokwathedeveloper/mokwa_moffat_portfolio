# Hero Image Responsiveness and Animation Enhancement

This document outlines the work done on the `fix/hero-section-revamp` branch to address the hero image implementation. The goal was to create a more professional, robust, and visually engaging hero section.

## Problem Statement

The previous implementation of the hero image, while functional, lacked the polish and advanced styling of a modern web portfolio. It used a standard `<img>` tag, which limited the possibilities for advanced CSS effects and animations.

## Solution Approach

The solution involved a complete refactoring of the hero image component, moving from a simple `<img>` tag to a `<div>` with a background image. This approach provides greater control over styling and allows for the implementation of CSS animations.

### Key Changes:

-   **HTML Refactoring:** The `<img>` tag within the `.headshot` container was replaced with a `<div>` with the ID `hero-image`. This provides a more semantic and stylistically flexible element to work with.

-   **CSS Styling:**
    -   The existing styles for the hero image were removed.
    -   New styles were created for the `#hero-image` div, using the `background-image` property to display the headshot.
    -   `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center` were used to ensure the image is always centered and fills the circular container without distortion.

-   **CSS Animation:**
    -   A subtle `pulse` animation was added to the hero image's `box-shadow`.
    -   This animation creates a gentle pulsing effect, drawing attention to the hero section and adding a dynamic element to the page.

## Implementation Details

1.  **`index.html`:**
    -   The `<img>` tag in the hero section was replaced with `<div id="hero-image"></div>`.

2.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   The old `.hero-section .headshot img` styles were removed.
    -   New styles for `#hero-image` were added, including the `background-image`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and the new `pulse` animation.
