# Hero Image Responsiveness Fix Branch Documentation

This branch addresses the responsiveness issues with the hero section image, specifically ensuring it maintains a perfect circular shape and scales correctly across all devices and browsers, including iPhones like the XR.

## Problem Statement

The hero section image, despite previous responsive efforts, does not consistently maintain its perfect circular shape and optimal scaling on certain mobile devices (e.g., iPhone XR). This indicates a subtle conflict between CSS sizing properties, the image's intrinsic aspect ratio, and the `border-radius` property.

## Solution Approach

The solution will involve a precise adjustment of CSS properties to ensure the image's container and the image itself work harmoniously to maintain the desired circular shape and responsive scaling. This will likely include:

-   **Explicit Aspect Ratio:** Using `aspect-ratio` on the image or its container to guarantee a 1:1 ratio.
-   **Flexible Sizing:** Refining `width` and `height` properties with responsive units (e.g., `vw`, `clamp()`) to ensure proper scaling.
-   **`object-fit`:** Confirming `object-fit: cover;` is correctly applied to prevent image distortion within the circular frame.
-   **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verifying the fix across various browsers and device emulators to ensure consistent behavior.

## Implementation Plan (File by File)

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   Inspect and modify the CSS rules for `.hero-section .headshot` and `.hero-section .headshot img`.
    -   Apply `aspect-ratio` and refine sizing properties.
    -   Ensure `object-fit: cover;` is correctly applied.
