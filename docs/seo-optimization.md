# SEO Optimization Branch Documentation

This branch focuses on improving the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the portfolio website to increase its visibility and ranking on search engines like Google.

## Key Areas of Improvement

- **Meta Tags:** Add and update meta tags (title, description, keywords, etc.) to provide search engines with more information about the website's content.
- **Semantic HTML:** Ensure the use of semantic HTML5 elements to improve the structure and accessibility of the website.
- **Image Optimization:** Add descriptive alt text to all images to improve accessibility and provide context to search engines.
- **Structured Data:** Implement structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) to provide search engines with more detailed information about the website's content, which can result in rich snippets in search results.
- **Font Loading Optimization:** Implemented `font-display=swap` to improve perceived loading performance and prevent Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT), which positively impacts Core Web Vitals and overall user experience, a key SEO factor.
