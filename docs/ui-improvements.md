# UI Improvements

This document outlines the work done to improve the UI of the portfolio website.

## Hero Image Responsiveness and Animation Enhancement

This section outlines the work done to ensure the hero image is responsive and visually engaging.

### Implementation Approach

The hero image is implemented using a semantic `<img>` tag, which allows for proper accessibility via `alt` attributes and efficient image loading. Styling is applied to this `<img>` element to achieve the desired visual effects.

#### Key Changes:

-   **HTML Structure:** The hero headshot is now represented by an `<img>` tag within the `.headshot` container.

-   **CSS Styling:**
    -   Styles are applied directly to the `.hero-headshot-img` class.
    -   `width: clamp(250px, 30vw, 350px)` ensures fluid sizing.
    -   `aspect-ratio: 1/1` and `border-radius: 50%` maintain the circular shape.
    -   A subtle `pulse` animation is applied via `box-shadow`.
    -   `object-fit: cover` prevents image distortion.

### Implementation Details

1.  **`index.html`:**
    -   The hero section now uses `<img src="images/hero-headshot.webp" alt="Mokwa Moffat Ohuru headshot" class="hero-headshot-img">`.

2.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   Styles for `.hero-headshot-img` have been defined, replacing previous `div#hero-image` styles.

## Testimonial Image Responsiveness Fix

This section outlines the work done on the `fix/testimonial-responsiveness` branch to address the responsiveness issues with the testimonial section images.

### Problem Statement

The testimonial section images were not scaling correctly on smaller screen sizes. The `clamp()` function used for sizing had a minimum value that was too large, causing the images to overflow their container on narrow screens.

### Solution Approach

The solution involved adjusting the `clamp()` values for the `.testimonial-img` class to ensure the images scale more gracefully across all screen sizes. A `min-width` was also added to prevent the images from becoming too small on very narrow devices.

#### Key Changes:

-   **CSS Adjustment:** The `clamp()` function for the `width` and `height` of the `.testimonial-img` was modified to ensure better visibility and scaling.
    -   The minimum value was changed from `60px` to `80px`.
    -   The maximum value was changed from `120px` to `150px`.
-   **Minimum Width:** A `min-width` of `80px` was added to ensure the images maintain a reasonable size even on the smallest screens.
-   **Image Source Simplification:** The `srcset` and `src` attributes for testimonial images were simplified to directly reference existing image files, resolving issues where `alt` text was displayed instead of images.
-   **Alt Attribute Update:** `alt` attributes for testimonial images were updated to be more generic and descriptive.
-   **Content Professionalism:** Testimonial text content was updated to be more professional and aligned with Mokwa Moffat's profile.

### Implementation Details

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   The `.testimonial-img` class was updated with the new `clamp()` values and the `min-width` property.
