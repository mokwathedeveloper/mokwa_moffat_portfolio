# UI Improvements

This document outlines the work done to improve the UI of the portfolio website.

## Hero Image Responsiveness and Animation Enhancement

This section outlines the work done on the `fix/hero-section-revamp` branch to address the hero image implementation. The goal was to create a more professional, robust, and visually engaging hero section.

### Problem Statement

The previous implementation of the hero image, while functional, lacked the polish and advanced styling of a modern web portfolio. It used a standard `<img>` tag, which limited the possibilities for advanced CSS effects and animations.

### Solution Approach

The solution involved a complete refactoring of the hero image component, moving from a simple `<img>` tag to a `<div>` with a background image. This approach provides greater control over styling and allows for the implementation of CSS animations.

#### Key Changes:

-   **HTML Refactoring:** The `<img>` tag within the `.headshot` container was replaced with a `<div>` with the ID `hero-image`. This provides a more semantic and stylistically flexible element to work with.

-   **CSS Styling:**
    -   The existing styles for the hero image were removed.
    -   New styles were created for the `#hero-image` div, using the `background-image` property to display the headshot.
    -   `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center` were used to ensure the image is always centered and fills the circular container without distortion.

-   **CSS Animation:**
    -   A subtle `pulse` animation was added to the hero image's `box-shadow`.
    -   This animation creates a gentle pulsing effect, drawing attention to the hero section and adding a dynamic element to the page.

### Implementation Details

1.  **`index.html`:**
    -   The `<img>` tag in the hero section was replaced with `<div id="hero-image"></div>`.

2.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   The old `.hero-section .headshot img` styles were removed.
    -   New styles for `#hero-image` were added, including the `background-image`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and the new `pulse` animation.

## Testimonial Image Responsiveness Fix

This section outlines the work done on the `fix/testimonial-responsiveness` branch to address the responsiveness issues with the testimonial section images.

### Problem Statement

The testimonial section images were not scaling correctly on smaller screen sizes. The `clamp()` function used for sizing had a minimum value that was too large, causing the images to overflow their container on narrow screens.

### Solution Approach

The solution involved adjusting the `clamp()` values for the `.testimonial-img` class to ensure the images scale more gracefully across all screen sizes. A `min-width` was also added to prevent the images from becoming too small on very narrow devices.

#### Key Changes:

-   **CSS Adjustment:** The `clamp()` function for the `width` and `height` of the `.testimonial-img` was modified.
    -   The minimum value was changed from `80px` to `60px`.
    -   The maximum value was changed from `150px` to `120px`.
-   **Minimum Width:** A `min-width` of `60px` was added to ensure the images maintain a reasonable size even on the smallest screens.

### Implementation Details

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   The `.testimonial-img` class was updated with the new `clamp()` values and the `min-width` property.
