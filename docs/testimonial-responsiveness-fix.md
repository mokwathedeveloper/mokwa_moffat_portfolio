# Testimonial Image Responsiveness Fix

This document outlines the work done on the `fix/testimonial-responsiveness` branch to address the responsiveness issues with the testimonial section images.

## Problem Statement

The testimonial section images were not scaling correctly on smaller screen sizes. The `clamp()` function used for sizing had a minimum value that was too large, causing the images to overflow their container on narrow screens.

## Solution Approach

The solution involved adjusting the `clamp()` values for the `.testimonial-img` class to ensure the images scale more gracefully across all screen sizes. A `min-width` was also added to prevent the images from becoming too small on very narrow devices.

### Key Changes:

-   **CSS Adjustment:** The `clamp()` function for the `width` and `height` of the `.testimonial-img` was modified.
    -   The minimum value was changed from `80px` to `60px`.
    -   The maximum value was changed from `150px` to `120px`.
-   **Minimum Width:** A `min-width` of `60px` was added to ensure the images maintain a reasonable size even on the smallest screens.

## Implementation Details

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   The `.testimonial-img` class was updated with the new `clamp()` values and the `min-width` property.
