# Re-address `text-fill-color` Error Branch Documentation

This branch re-addresses the "Unknown property: 'text-fill-color'" error that has reappeared in the `styles.css` file. This error is caused by the use of a non-standard CSS property that is not supported by all browsers.

## Problem Re-occurrence

Despite previous attempts to fix this, the error has re-emerged, indicating that the previous solution might have been overwritten or was not robust enough to prevent its re-introduction during subsequent merges or changes.

## Solution Approach

The solution will involve a more robust and explicit replacement of the `-webkit-text-fill-color` and `text-fill-color` properties with a widely supported and compatible method for achieving gradient text effects. This typically involves using `background-clip: text` in conjunction with `color: transparent`.

## Implementation Plan (File by File)

1.  **`styles.css`:**
    -   Identify all instances of `text-fill-color` and `-webkit-text-fill-color`.
    -   Replace them with `color: transparent;` and ensure `background-clip: text;` is applied to the same element.
    -   Verify that the gradient text effect is preserved and no new errors are introduced.
