# Projects Branch Documentation

This branch focuses on the development of the projects section for the portfolio website.

## Features Implemented

- **Project Showcase:** The projects section now showcases two key projects: the "Advocate Booking & Case Management App" and the "Flix Movie Discovery App".
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Each project includes a detailed description, key features, and a link to the live application.
- **Clickable Headlines:** The project headlines are now clickable links, improving the user experience.
- **Subtle Hover Effect:** The hover effect on the project cards has been adjusted to be more subtle and professional.

## Component Structure

- **`index.html`:** The HTML structure for the projects section is contained within a `<section>` element with the id `projects`. Each project is contained within a `div` with the class `project`.
- **`styles.css`:** The CSS for the projects section is implemented using a mobile-first approach. It includes styles for the layout, typography, and the project card hover effect.
